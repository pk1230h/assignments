# Oh-my-zsh Plugin

Add the mvn plugin in ~/.zshrc file under the plugins section. Open a new terminal and use the alias command and grep to mvn. Pipe the output to wc -l to give the list of commands that the mvn plugin added.

You can use vi and leverage asscinema to capture the step/commands or just create a video. Or just provide the commands and the ouptput.
